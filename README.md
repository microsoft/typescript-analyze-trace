# @typescript/analyze-trace
Tool for analyzing the output of `tsc --generateTrace` automatically, rather than following the steps [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Performance-Tracing).

Note: The goal is to identify clear-cut hot-spots and provide enough context to extract a small repro.
The repro can then be used as the basis of a bug report or a starting point for manual code inspection or profiling.

## Usage

First, build your project with `--generateTrace traceDir`

For a sorted list of compilation hot-spots, run `npx analyze-trace traceDir`

For a simplified view of a types file (useful when investigating an individual trace), run `npx simplify-trace-types traceDir\types.json output_path`

To pretty-print individual types from a types file (faster than processing the entire file), run `npx print-types traceDir\types.json id+`
